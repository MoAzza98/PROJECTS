# Become a hero of legend
Collect epic items, backed with blockchain technology to track your achievements. Slay dragons, duel bosses, lead raids and don mythical gear in order to become the most legendary hero the world has ever seen. 
Leveraging blockchain technology, your NFTs will contain data such as your killcount, bosses slain, zones travelled, raids overcome and more, allowing your very weapons and heroes to become part of a rich in-game history, built entirely by the players.

## A gameplay first approach

Our game design philosophy has always been simple; build enjoyable experiences. We take a gameplay first approach to development that allows us to integrate and leverage blockchain technology in unique and intelligent ways. We believe that a great game can be elevated by thoughtful integration, which is what we aim to do with our blockchain integrations. We will be regularly taking in player feedback, as well as tuning systems throughout our development cycle in order to deliver the best possible experience.

## Partake in exclusive raids

As you progress through the world of Sinia, the world will unfold around you, offering up new and unique experiences. Our staged progression system tracks the level of progression you have on your NFTs on-chain through multiple stats such as kill count and raids completed, and allows high ranking players the chance to participate in exclusive ultra-hard content designed to challenge players who have invested time into the world, with a chance to win huge rewards.

## Craft your own hero

Customise, create and play as your very own custom hero, embarking through the world with a unique experience as you socialise, cooperate with and compete against other players to turn your name into that of legend. Players who reach the top will be inscribed in the in-game lore scroll, immortalizing their achievements and names for all to see. This information can dynamically update and change as players compete for the title of the greatest. Giving the world a rich, player written history unlike any other thanks to blockchain technology.
